dgrampy (for 2023 epixhr)
1. Support different array types
2. Support string/ scalar value
3. Unifying PyDgram and psana.dgram.Dgram
4. Use .dgram to create other transitions
5. Autogenerate nodeId and namesId when not given
6. Add remove(det, alg) method


TMO Preparation for MHz run
peakfinding + data writing
  Future -> test on real hexanode data (we still missing peaks). Backup plan -> roentdek hexanode alg works on quadanode non-fex data.
TMO spectrum analysis
Covariance calculation w Taran's code


Control dynamically allocated hosts idea
1. through SBATCH
2. see detail of slurm host file for special config.
3. ask Elliott 


Convert xtc1 to xtc2
1. Check how to read xtc1 and put or save them in an intermediate format (zmq or hdf5)
2. Finish dgrampy
3. For calibration constant, Chris mentioned that itâ€™not recommended to port lcls1 calibration constant to lcls2. What have been done was to put directly calibrated data in xtc2 format. We can figure if this is also okay for us.
