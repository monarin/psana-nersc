Running Live mode
NOTE: 
- To be fix: psana2 did not exit when it sees EndRun (still continue read retry)
- Disable seems to work - psana2 was waiting and when it sees Enable, it starts to
  read again. Ric mentioned that there could be a pause of says 5 minutes between
  Diable and Enable. 

TMO spectrum analysis

dgrampy (for 2023 epixhr)
1. Support different array types
2. Support string/ scalar value
3. Unifying PyDgram and psana.dgram.Dgram
4. Use .dgram to create other transitions
5. Autogenerate nodeId and namesId when not given
6. Add remove(det, alg) method

peakfinding + data writing
1. Future -> test on real hexanode data (we still missing peaks). Backup plan -> roentdek hexanode alg works on quadanode non-fex data.

control dynamically allocated hosts idea
1. through SBATCH
2. see detail of slurm host file for special config.
3. ask Elliott
