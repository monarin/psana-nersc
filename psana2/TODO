0. Streaming only performance
   - Looks like there's too much of data going between smd0 and eb cores.
     Move pixel_index_map and pixel_position to BeginRun for MPI.Bcast
   - Generates bigger dataset to max out bandwidth
     4TB
1. If camera runs at 5 (or 25) kHz, how many core and how often do we need to call reduce?
2. Segfault when reading data generated from dgram with large no. of events 120 * 10667 = 1280040 events
/cds/home/m/monarin/Save/parallelreader.pyx_2022-05-28+142758
for print out
3. Spinifel needs support for per-evt pixel position reciprocal
   Use mean wavelength
4. Early termination by bd/eb cores
   Smd0 is waiting (IRecv) on special bd/eb signal
- 1600 N_images_per_rank error
- Output not shown in /spinifel_output/testxtc2
- Regenerate data with BeginRun exp=xpptut15 run=1 and rename files to data-r0001-s000-c000.xtc2


TODO:
1. Try to wrap xtc TransitionId value enum class and apply it in SmdReader and DgramPy
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31001918/wrap-enum-class-with-cython


Live mode test
- Keep up with 1MHz rate data from daq here 
  /cds/data/drpsrcf/tst/tstx00417/xtc/ 


Dgrampy (for 2023 epixhr)
- Check mem leak for ex-03-duplicate-data.py
- Rule for generating NamesId is the lowest from the range available 
e.g. 0,1,2,...,255 
next NamesId is 3


To solve EnvStore prolem on Eb
[Add EnvStore to EvenBuilder nodes]
Filter callback can take loops
[ds.run_this_filer(filter_fn)]

def filter_fn(ds): # EventBuilder cores
    # Any avai. types of loop as on BD cores

Option #1
def filter2(): # This works on smalldata
  ds = DataSource() # New datasource 
  for run ...
    for evt ... (smd events)

Option #2
def filter2(ds):
    for run in ds.runs():
       for evt >>>


# main on bd
ds = DataSource() # This works on bigdata
for run ...
  for evt ..  (bd events)
