SmallData callback
- Check usage of generator/iterator in RunSmallData



TMO:
Xtc vs HDF5 analysis



RIX 33k - 1MHz:
Detectors: APD point detector, 2x Andors + 2x KBO ++ (~ 12 streams)
APD - Integrated over a range -> returns scalar
VLS - Entire spectrum
Shot filtering, data binning. 

Data: (Experiment: /Run: )
0. Andor set at 33kHz (real case is 1Hz)
1. Test data should cover the normal cases (% hits etc). 
2. We should have results that can be validated at the end of the test.
Algorithms:
1. How to setup? Libraries needed. 
2. + writing to hdf5. 
3. Smalldata processing script (interface such as filtering, roi/ available in lcls2) --> hdf5
4. Analysis script works on hdf5

Timing



Clean Up
- dir in DataSource should be strip()
- DgramPy createTransition causes memory leak for PyXtcUpdateIer



Aug/Sept 2022
- Integrate psana2 streaming function to spinifel
- Support DgramEdit for DrpPython and data conversion for ExaFEL
