Updates 10/09/2024
    - update firmware for camera link nodes (FIM and Opal to version 3.8.1?) from Julian. 
    - psana damage handling (OIP)
    - spare nodes using riccardo's ansible
    - test all detectors
    - fiber BER
    - psana2 scaling issue within a node (Wilko may also look at this)
    - archon calibration
    - psana sz/lz decompress performance
For psana2 scaling issue I suggest you copy what Mikhail did here for psana1: https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/PSDMInternal/Scaling+behavior+of+psana1+-+Part+2+-+test+with+command+perf+stat#Scalingbeh[…]commandperf.  The code that is not scaling well within a node is in s3df in ~cpo/problems/isele_bad_scaling/preproc_v4.py.  We can eliminate the SRV stuff (i.e. smd.event() calls) and still see the problem I think.  The results of the scaling measurements we did with Erik are here: ~cpo/problems/tmo_isele_perf (NOT on s3df: the old system).  We should probably discuss all this on zoom … too much typing otherwise!

- live mode sleep problem (don't know how to fix this, but we should try)
- epixM (onsite: get the detector from dionisio)
- more timing fibers for ric epixhr emulation
- live mode sleep problem (don't know how to fix this, but we should try)
- destination callback (conflicts with integrating detector?). work with silke,andy@txi
