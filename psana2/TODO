New TODO 8/25/2023
- mpi/mpi4py with pmi2 on s3df (currently pmix from conda)
    - ompi_info > xx shows that openmpi uses pmix
    - slurm on s3df doesn't support pmix
        - running srun -N1 -n2 --mpi=list shows
            MPI plugin types are...
                cray_shasta
                none
                pmi2
        - need to install openmpi with pmi2 (supported by s3df slurm)
            ./configure --prefix=/sdf/home/m/monarin/sw --with-pmi=/opt/slurm/slurm-22.05.2/include/slurm --with-slurm --with-pmi-libdir=/opt/slurm/slurm-22.05.2/lib64/slurm
          * found libpmi2.h but missing libpmi2.so - see this article (they need to install this)
          https://bugs.schedmd.com/show_bug.cgi?id=7236
            
        - try: --mpi= (https://slurm.schedmd.com/mpi_guide.html)
- constants broadcast in drp?
- epixM (get the detector from dionisio)
- more timing fibers for ric epixhr emulation
- destination callback (conflicts with integrating detector?). work with silke,andy@txi

Spinifel
- fsc stand-alone script
- chimera wiki
- report
- mpi multiple conformation


Q1: Oct-Dec 2022
Preparation for running rix and tmo experiments at 33kHz
Metric:
- Scaling plots for smallldata and hdf5-jupyter analysis scripts.
Run ExaFEL Demo 2022 for psana2 streaming mode
Metric:
- Strong/weak scaling for spinifel with psana2-mpi
- Merged psana2 branch to development 
- Quickstart guide updated (psana2 in streaming mode as default)
- Fall cleaning items completed
Q2: Jan-Mar 2023
Understanding DAQ system
Q3: Apr-Jun 2023
Frontier
Q4: July-Sep 2023
DAQ

Enabling experiment-based offline data analysis features at 1MHz. 
- Event loop and Run access in SmallData callback
- Performance measured at 1.5kHz/EventBuilder (6.5 KHz without the callback)
- Broadcasting calibration constants for DRP and Shared Memory data access
