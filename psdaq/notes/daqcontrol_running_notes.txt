## Old notes how to run Daq on different systems
### for rix
ssh -YC rix-daq -l rixopr
cd /cds/group/pcds/dist/pds/rix/scripts/

### for tmo
- ssh -YC tmo-daq -l tmoopr (kinit if asked for password)
- cd /cds/group/pcds/dist/pds/tmo/scripts/
- cd daq (softlinked to scripts) see restart_daq.sh for proof
- source setup_env.sh
- tmo.cnf (python style settings - select/deselect list of hw)
- restart_daq.sh (run this manually so log files get delivered to default location)
    procmgr start tmo.cnf
    procmgr stop tmo.cnf
- select instruments (simple settings: timing and ami)
- select recording for writing data to disk
- working with daq control:
    cheat sequence: CONFIGURED,
    https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/PSDMInternal/Finite+State+Machine
- checking where the xtc2 files are saved to:
    grep "smd.xtc2" 2022/11/21_15\:56\:42_*
    /cds/data/drpsrcf/tmo/tmox1004221/xtc
- monitoring performance grafana
    select instrument: tmo

### Running with test cameras:
- Running at rix: be on drp-srcf-mon001
- Make sure ami is installed
  source ~/lcls2/setup_env.sh
  cd
  git clone git@github.com:slac-lcls/ami.git
  cd ami
  ./build_all.sh
- cd /cds/data/drpsrcf/users/monarin/daq-live
- procmgr start mona.cnf (LINE 9: hutch, user, password = ('tst', 'tstopr', 'pcds'))
  Note: mona.cnf is a soft link to /cds/home/m/monarin/lcls2/psdaq/psdaq/cnf/mona.cnf
- [Optional] - Check BEAM configures using Edit button on DAQ Control
- DAQ Control
    - Partition Select -> Select all partitions -> Apply
    - Recording
    - Target State: Configure
- DAQ:NEH
    - Group 6 -> Fixed Rate --> Choose Rate
- DAQ Control
    - Target State: Running
    - [Change Rate] Target state: Paused (Use DAQ:NEH to change rate)

### Running at FEE (Note from Riccardo)
The front end you should connect to is: drp-neh-ctl002
The available timing nodes are: drp-neh-cmp001 cmp002 and cmp010
We were saying that teb is on cmp016
If you need to see where things are the fee_teststand.cnf has been committed in git in lcls2/psdaq/psdaq/cnf/
Note: timing is on cmp015 and the writing user is tmoopr (starts pyxmp), this is different from tstopr used
in the fee_teststand.cnf

### CNF file
task_set  = 'taskset -c 4-63'
std_opts  = '-P tst -C drp-srcf-cmp004 -M /cds/group/psdm/psdatmgr/etc/config/prom/tst'
std_opts0 = std_opts + '-d /dev/datadev_0 -o /cds/data/drpsrcf -k batching=yes,directIO=yes'
drp_cmd0  = task_set + ' drp ' + std_opts0
