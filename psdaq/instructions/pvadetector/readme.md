# üì¶ PvDetector Buffer Allocation Overview

This section documents the buffer allocations involved in setting up a large PvDetector (e.g., 5Mpix Axis camera at RIX producing ~74‚ÄØMiB images). The memory architecture spans both the **PGP kernel driver** and **DRP user-space process**, with buffer size coordination critical for stable performance.

## üìã Buffer Summary Table

| **Buffer Type**        | **Component**              | **Set By**                                  | **Size**                                  | **Notes**                                                                 |
|------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **DMA Buffers**        | PGP Kernel Driver          | `cfgRxCount` and `cfgSize`                  | `cfgRxCount √ó cfgSize`<br>e.g., `80 √ó 1MiB = 80MiB` | Must hold the entire image (no overrun). Acts as a ring buffer.           |
| **Pebble Buffers**     | `DrpBase::MemPool`         | `pebbleBufCount` and `pebbleBufSize` kwargs (`-k`) | e.g., `128 √ó 84MiB = 10.8GiB`             | Used by DRP process to store full datagrams. Count defaults to next power of 2 above `cfgRxCount`. |
| **Transition Buffers** | `PvaDetector::PvMonitor`   | Tied to `pebbleBufCount`                    | e.g., `128 √ó 74MiB = 9.2GiB`               | Cannot be resized directly; size taken from DRP dgram payload. Tied 1:1 with pebble count. |

## üß† Key Points

- The **PGP DMA Buffers** must be large enough to receive a single full image, otherwise the DMA engine will overrun and data loss will occur.
- The **Pebble Buffers** are user-space buffers used for event building. They are allocated in `DrpBase::MemPool`.
- The **Transition Buffers** are used internally by `PvaDetector::PvMonitor` for holding and staging PV data during acquisition. They are sized based on image payload and cannot be resized via kwargs.
- The buffer counts (`pebbleBufCount`) are typically set to a power-of-two value greater than `cfgRxCount` to avoid indexing and overflow issues.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Asymmetry Between DMA and Pebble Buffers

One important design detail in the DAQ system is the **asymmetry** between how **DMA buffers** and **pebble buffers** are used:

| Aspect              | **DMA Buffers**                              | **Pebble Buffers**                              |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Created by**      | Device driver (`cfgRxCount`, `cfgSize`)       | User-space via `pebble.create()`                |
| **Purpose**         | Streaming image fragments via PGP             | Holding a full event (image + metadata)         |
| **Size per buffer** | Small (e.g., 1‚ÄØMiB)                            | Large (e.g., full image size, e.g., 84‚ÄØMiB)      |
| **Usage**           | One image spans multiple DMA buffers          | One image fits entirely in one pebble buffer    |
| **Mapping**         | Many DMA buffers per image                    | One pebble buffer per image                     |
| **Memory location** | Kernel-mapped (hardware DMA)                  | User-space (DAQ process)                        |

### üîç Why This Matters

- The number of **pebble buffers** is directly tied to the number of DMA buffers (`cfgRxCount`) to ensure every in-flight DMA event has a matching location in user-space memory.
- **Pebble and transition buffers are large**, so increasing `cfgRxCount` (e.g., from 64 ‚Üí 2048) without caution can lead to **massive memory allocation** (e.g., hundreds of GB).
- To avoid buffer overrun and excessive memory use, you must **balance**:
  - `cfgRxCount √ó cfgSize` ‚â• one image (so DMA doesn‚Äôt overflow)
  - `pebbleBufCount √ó pebbleBufSize` fits in system memory

### üí° Pro Tip

If you‚Äôre handling large images (e.g., 84‚ÄØMiB), try to **keep `cfgRxCount` low** (just enough to hold one image) and **use `pebbleBufCount`** to control the number of concurrent events. This avoids allocating unnecessary large buffer regions while still ensuring safe operation.
