## Bringing up DAQ after timing glitches
In this example, we focus on rix-daq by trying to bring all detectors back after a timing glitch. The list of detectors currently on rix.cnf (20230721) is shown below:
```

### Use loopback to wake up the KCU
This is observed on cmp002 and cmp025. Running kcuSim cmd shows that remoteid is incorrect (all ones) and linkUp is 0. 
```
(ps-4.5.26) monarin@drp-srcf-cmp002 ~ üëÅ)$ kcuSim -s
-- Core Axi Version --

...
            remoteid ffffffff
...
              linkUp        0

```
On cmp002, we tried different things including hitting TxLinkReset on xmppva, swapping connections on the BOS with other known xpm, etc. What worked was we use a loopback fiber on the dead lane, see the linkUp (should be 1) and swap back to the correct fiber (possibly powe cycle the nodes in between). At the end, we saw that linkUp stayed at 1.
Note that on cmp025, the node seems to fix itself.
